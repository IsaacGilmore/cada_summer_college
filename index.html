A player piano, metal drums, a radio broadcast, a recording of the artist explaining his work, and a competing shrill voice correcting him provided the cacophonic sound track to the machine’s self-destruction—until it was stopped short by the fire department."

              Instead of killing enemies and getting badass equipment like she used to, she started traveling to major towns to discuss the ways in which women are treated in the game-space with other players. This led to longer discussions about feminism with players from geographically varied places meeting together in this virtual but spatial and representative corporatized public space. The conversations she facilitated are documented and reproduced in videos and images online. More recently she started performing the process live for audiences, projecting her screen and doing live-narration of the conversations as they unfold.
